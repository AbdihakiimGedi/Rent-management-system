# Image Upload Fix for Rental System

## Issues Fixed

1. **Image Upload Not Working**: Added proper file upload endpoint and frontend handling
2. **Images Not Displaying**: Fixed image display in rental item cards and detail views
3. **Custom Fields Showing**: Properly separated image/file fields from text fields
4. **Backend File Handling**: Added image upload endpoint with proper file storage

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **New Upload Endpoint**: Added `/owner/upload-image` route in `Backend/app/routes/owner.py`
2. **File Storage**: Images are stored in `Backend/uploads/rental_items/` directory
3. **Static File Serving**: Backend serves uploaded files via `/uploads/<filename>` route

### Frontend Changes

1. **API Integration**: Added `uploadImage` method to `ownerApi.js`
2. **Form Handling**: Updated `RentalItemForm.jsx` to properly upload images
3. **Image Display**: Updated `RentalItemList.jsx` to show images in cards
4. **Detail View**: Updated `RentalItemDetail.jsx` to display images separately

## How It Works

### 1. Image Upload Process

1. User selects an image file in the rental item form
2. Frontend calls `ownerApi.uploadImage()` with the file
3. Backend saves the image to `uploads/rental_items/` directory
4. Backend returns the file path (e.g., `rental_items/abc123.jpg`)
5. Frontend stores the file path in `dynamic_data` JSON field

### 2. Image Display

1. **In List View**: Rental item cards show the first available image
2. **In Detail View**: All images are displayed in a dedicated "Images & Documents" section
3. **In Form**: Existing images are shown as "Current image", new uploads as "New image preview"

### 3. File Storage Structure

```
Backend/
├── uploads/
│   └── rental_items/
│       ├── abc123.jpg
│       ├── def456.png
│       └── ghi789.webp
```

## Database Structure

The `dynamic_data` JSON field stores image paths like this:
```json
{
  "Item Name": "Car Suzuki",
  "Licence card": "rental_items/abc123.jpg",
  "Car photo": "rental_items/def456.png",
  "Insurance": "rental_items/ghi789.pdf"
}
```

## Supported File Types

- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Max Size**: 5MB per file

## Usage Instructions

### For Owners (Adding New Items)

1. Go to "Add New Item" page
2. Select a category
3. Fill in required fields
4. For image fields, click "Choose File" and select an image
5. Image will be uploaded automatically
6. Submit the form

### For Owners (Editing Items)

1. Go to item detail page
2. Click "Edit Item"
3. Existing images will be shown as "Current image"
4. Upload new images to replace existing ones
5. Save changes

### For Admins (Category Requirements)

1. When creating categories, use field names that include "image" or "photo" for image fields
2. Set field type to "file"
3. These fields will automatically be treated as image uploads

## Technical Notes

- Images are automatically resized to max 800x800 pixels for performance
- Unique filenames are generated to prevent conflicts
- File paths are stored relative to the uploads directory
- Static file serving is handled by Flask's `send_from_directory`

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Displaying
1. Check if the `uploads` directory exists in Backend folder
2. Verify file permissions on the uploads directory
3. Check browser console for 404 errors on image requests

### Upload Failing
1. Check if the backend is running
2. Verify the `/owner/upload-image` endpoint is accessible
3. Check file size (max 5MB)
4. Ensure file type is supported

### File Path Issues
1. Verify `dynamic_data` contains proper file paths
2. Check if paths start with `rental_items/`
3. Ensure backend static file serving is working

## Future Improvements

1. **Image Compression**: Add client-side image compression before upload
2. **Multiple Images**: Support for multiple images per field
3. **Image Gallery**: Better image viewing experience
4. **CDN Integration**: Move images to cloud storage for better performance
5. **Image Validation**: Add more sophisticated image validation and processing
